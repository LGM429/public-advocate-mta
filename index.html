				Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called on the city Wednesday to ramp up accessibility services in the transit system. Williams spoke alongside advocates inside the Jay St-Metro Tech station, one of the only stations that has elevators, braille station maps and tactile pathways
            </p>
			<p>
				“Accessibility is not a privilege,” Williams said, “It needs to be a priority.”
			</p>
            <p> 
                The public advocate’s office has released a <a href="https://advocate.nyc.gov/reports/out-service-creating-equitable-transit-system-new-york-city" target="_blank">report on transit accessibility,</a> focusing on current MTA issues and future recommendations.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This spring, a federal judge approved a settlement to an accessibility rights class-action lawsuit. The settlement requires the MTA to build elevators and/or ramps at 95 percent of its stations by 2055.  
            </p>
            <p>
                “Not only is that far behind where we need to be, we’re not on pace to keep that timeline,” Williams said. He argued for money to be spent on accessibility and repairs instead of cosmetic changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MTA is expanding elevator services at 17 stations across the city. Most stations, however, remain inaccessible to those who have trouble climbing stairs. 
            </p>
            <P> 
                Out of 472 subway stations across the five boroughs, less than a quarter are accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
            </P>
			<p>
                “A station is not fully accessible just because there is elevator access,” Williams said, speaking of the issues people with sensory or cognitive disabilities face when taking public transit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, the MTA promised $5.2 billion to improve accessibility at 67 stations. Currently, there are 34 current construction projects going on throughout the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                “For blind people, there is no real way to navigate,” said Jessica Murray, organizer from Rise and Resist’s Elevator Action Group. “We need to take it to the next step.”
            </p>
            <p>
                A visually impaired person will find tactile pathways only at Jay St-Metro Tech station. Platform information kiosks that show train arrivals and delays don’t have audio functions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Public transportation is a lifeblood of New York City, and it is simply cut off from some individuals,” said Jeff Peters, communications director for the Center for Independence of Disabled New Yorkers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The public advocate led a walkthrough of the accessibility services at Jay St-Metro Tech. He pointed out the issues he saw: the out-of-service elevator, un-maintained tactile pathways and the “NaviLens” app-specific QR code, aimed to help the visually impaired.
            </p>
            <p>
                Passersby could easily mistake the colorful QR code for modern art, and completely miss the miniscule font at the bottom of the sign that reads, “NaviLens.com – Empowering the Visually Impaired.”

                Michael J. Schweinsburg, president of 504 Democratic Club, said there are over 2 million New Yorkers with some type of accessibility impairment. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Disability Health Data System, one-quarter of New Yorkers have a disability status.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility improvement benefits the non-disabled, too, Schweinsburg said, citing the “curb-cut effect” that began in the 1970s with disability activists creating crude cement ramps in Berkeley.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Pedestrian ramps in New York not only make streets finally accessible to wheelchair users and those with walking impairments, but also help mothers with strollers, people with shopping carts and skateboarders, Schweinsburg said. “All of it benefits everyone.”
